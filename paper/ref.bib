    abstract = { We investigate a method of dividing an irregular mesh into equal-sized pieces with few interconnecting edges. The method's novel feature is that it exploits the geometric coordinates of the mesh vertices. It is based on theoretical work of Miller, Teng, Thurston, and Vavasis, who showed that certain classes of "well-shaped" finite-element meshes have good separators. The geometric method is quite simple to implement: we describe a \sc Matlab code for it in some detail. The method is also quite efficient and effective: we compare it with some other methods, including spectral bisection. }

    abstract = {Scalable parallel computing is essential for processing large scale-free (power-law) graphs. The distribution of data across processes becomes important on distributed-memory computers with thousands of cores. It has been shown that two-dimensional layouts (edge partitioning) can have significant advantages over traditional one-dimensional layouts. However, simple 2D block distribution does not use the structure of the graph, and more advanced 2D partitioning methods are too expensive for large graphs. We propose a new two-dimensional partitioning algorithm that combines graph partitioning with 2D block distribution. The computational cost of the algorithm is essentially the same as 1D graph partitioning. We study the performance of sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) for scale-free graphs from the web and social networks using several different partitioners and both 1D and 2D data layouts. We show that SpMV run time is reduced by exploiting the graph's structure. Contrary to popular belief, we observe that current graph and hypergraph partitioners often yield relatively good partitions on scale-free graphs. We demonstrate that our new 2D partitioning method consistently outperforms the other methods considered, for both SpMV and an eigensolver, on matrices with up to 1.6 billion nonzeros using up to 16,384 cores.},

    abstract = { The most commonly used p-way partitioning method is recursive bisection (RB). It first divides a graph or a mesh into two equal-sized pieces, by a "good" bisection algorithm, and then recursively divides the two pieces. Ideally, we would like to use an optimal bisection algorithm. Because the optimal bisection problem that partitions a graph into two equal-sized subgraphs to minimize the number of edges cut is NP-complete, practical RB algorithms use more efficient heuristics in place of an optimal bisection algorithm. Most such heuristics are designed to find the best possible bisection within allowed time. We show that the RB method, even when an optimal bisection algorithm is assumed, may produce a p-way partition that is very far way from the optimal one. Our negative result is complemented by two positive ones: first we show that for some important classes of graphs that occur in practical applications, such as well-shaped finite-element and finite-difference meshes, RB is within a constant factor of the optimal one "almost always." Second, we show that if the balance condition is relaxed so that each block in the p-way partition is bounded by 2n/p, where n is the number of vertices of the graph, then a modified RB finds an approximately balanced p-way partition whose cost is within an O(log p) factor of the cost of the optimal p-way partition. }
