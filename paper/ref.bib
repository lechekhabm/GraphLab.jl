    abstract = { We investigate a method of dividing an irregular mesh into equal-sized pieces with few interconnecting edges. The method's novel feature is that it exploits the geometric coordinates of the mesh vertices. It is based on theoretical work of Miller, Teng, Thurston, and Vavasis, who showed that certain classes of "well-shaped" finite-element meshes have good separators. The geometric method is quite simple to implement: we describe a \sc Matlab code for it in some detail. The method is also quite efficient and effective: we compare it with some other methods, including spectral bisection. }

    abstract = {Scalable parallel computing is essential for processing large scale-free (power-law) graphs. The distribution of data across processes becomes important on distributed-memory computers with thousands of cores. It has been shown that two-dimensional layouts (edge partitioning) can have significant advantages over traditional one-dimensional layouts. However, simple 2D block distribution does not use the structure of the graph, and more advanced 2D partitioning methods are too expensive for large graphs. We propose a new two-dimensional partitioning algorithm that combines graph partitioning with 2D block distribution. The computational cost of the algorithm is essentially the same as 1D graph partitioning. We study the performance of sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) for scale-free graphs from the web and social networks using several different partitioners and both 1D and 2D data layouts. We show that SpMV run time is reduced by exploiting the graph's structure. Contrary to popular belief, we observe that current graph and hypergraph partitioners often yield relatively good partitions on scale-free graphs. We demonstrate that our new 2D partitioning method consistently outperforms the other methods considered, for both SpMV and an eigensolver, on matrices with up to 1.6 billion nonzeros using up to 16,384 cores.},

    abstract = { The most commonly used p-way partitioning method is recursive bisection (RB). It first divides a graph or a mesh into two equal-sized pieces, by a "good" bisection algorithm, and then recursively divides the two pieces. Ideally, we would like to use an optimal bisection algorithm. Because the optimal bisection problem that partitions a graph into two equal-sized subgraphs to minimize the number of edges cut is NP-complete, practical RB algorithms use more efficient heuristics in place of an optimal bisection algorithm. Most such heuristics are designed to find the best possible bisection within allowed time. We show that the RB method, even when an optimal bisection algorithm is assumed, may produce a p-way partition that is very far way from the optimal one. Our negative result is complemented by two positive ones: first we show that for some important classes of graphs that occur in practical applications, such as well-shaped finite-element and finite-difference meshes, RB is within a constant factor of the optimal one "almost always." Second, we show that if the balance condition is relaxed so that each block in the p-way partition is bounded by 2n/p, where n is the number of vertices of the graph, then a modified RB finds an approximately balanced p-way partition whose cost is within an O(log p) factor of the cost of the optimal p-way partition. }

During the last decade, many algorithms have been proposed to address such task; however, only a few of them have been integrated into a common framework, making it hard to use and compare different solutions. To support developers, researchers and practitioners, in this paper we introduce a python library - namely CDlib - designed to serve this need. The aim of CDlib is to allow easy and standardized access to a wide variety of network clustering algorithms, to evaluate and compare the results they provide, and to visualize them. It notably provides the largest available collection of community detection implementations, with a total of 39 algorithms.},

    abstract = {Biological networks capture structural or functional properties of relevant entities such as molecules, proteins or genes. Characteristic examples are gene expression networks or protein–protein interaction networks, which hold information about functional affinities or structural similarities. Such networks have been expanding in size due to increasing scale and abundance of biological data. While various clustering algorithms have been proposed to find highly connected regions, Markov Clustering (MCL) has been one of the most successful approaches to cluster sequence similarity or expression networks. Despite its popularity, MCL’s scalability to cluster large datasets still remains a bottleneck due to high running times and memory demands. Here, we present High-performance MCL (HipMCL), a parallel implementation of the original MCL algorithm that can run on distributed-memory computers. We show that HipMCL can efficiently utilize 2000 compute nodes and cluster a network of ∼70 million nodes with ∼68 billion edges in ∼2.4 h. By exploiting distributed-memory environments, HipMCL clusters large-scale networks several orders of magnitude faster than MCL and enables clustering of even bigger networks. HipMCL is based on MPI and OpenMP and is freely available under a modified BSD license.},

abstract = {If you had to buy just one text on algorithms, Introduction to Algorithms is a magnificent choice. The book begins by considering the mathematical foundations of the analysis of algorithms and maintains this mathematical rigor throughout the work. The tools developed in these opening sections are then applied to sorting, data structures, graphs, and a variety of selected algorithms including computational geometry, string algorithms, parallel models of computation, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), and more. This book's strength lies in its encyclopedic range, clear exposition, and powerful analysis. Pseudo-code explanation of the algorithms coupled with proof of their accuracy makes this book is a great resource on the basic tools used to analyze the performance of algorithms.}
